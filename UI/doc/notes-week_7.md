# Notes

This is a collection of thoughts and processes we had when making this part of
the application. It marks a good place to put weird artifacts that we found
about, say, libraries we used that were either too lengthy or innapropriate for
in-line comments.

## Week 7 - Getting GStreamer to play nicely

GStreamer is pretty complicated. There aren't a lot of guides out there and I
have to try and find the Gstramer*mm* documentations in particular. I eventually
came across [this Medium
article](https://medium.com/lifesjourneythroughalens/implementing-gstreamer-webcam-usb-internal-streaming-mac-c-clion-76de0fdb8b34)
explaining the general layout and getting me up and running, and then I moved
on to the [official Freedesktop
documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/index.html).
