# OpenCV Image Stitching Module 


Compile with: make

To run the program, run the python script by typing:
./compose.py 

If this doesn't work due to access rights, make sure to add executing privileges
to the script by typing: sudo chmod +x compose.py 

The 'output' directory contains both the images captured by the camera, as well 
as the output image of the stitcher code.

As of right now, 'output' is meant to be a sort of temporary directory for 
creating panoramic images.
